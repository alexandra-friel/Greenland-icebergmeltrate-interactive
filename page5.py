            - ICE-AGE is designed as a database that can grow and evolve. The full code and workflow for ICE-AGE will be publicly accessible. ICE-AGE is meant as a community resource to reduce the idea-to-research timeline for iceberg-focused research. Within our team, ICE-AGE will inform ongoing work focused on improved freshwater flux estimates for Greenland and improved representation of iceberg-derived freshwater flux in models using DEM-differenced melt rates and an iceberg melt model.
